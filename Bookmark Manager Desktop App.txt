(about how the application work)


pseudo explanation: â†“

somehow get chrome bookmarks --> app takes them(decide which one and what to use) and simply prints them --> user can make search in each folder/subfolder + hover to preview them - --> EXTRA FEATURES: user can add little notes to each one of them ... (saves eye pollution and easier way to see whats on the website + what did the user take as note when he/she previously visited that website)
